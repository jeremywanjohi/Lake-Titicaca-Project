          <h3>Shared Stewardship on the Reeds</h3>
          <p>The reed‑built islands function as tight‑knit micro‑communities. <strong>Each household unit</strong> generally includes extended family, with elder members guiding decisions on island upkeep and resource sharing. Leadership rotates among respected elders, ensuring <em>collective stewardship</em> over limited space and supplies.</p>
          <p>Children learn through apprenticeship—helping repair reed layers, tending fishing nets, and caring for younger siblings—fostering early responsibility and cooperation from a young age.</p>

          <h3>Lanterns & Pan‑Flutes</h3>
          <p>Festivals center on the rhythmic <strong>dance of totora reeds</strong>, symbolizing life’s cyclical nature. During the annual “Fiesta de la Luz,” residents illuminate their islands with lanterns woven from reeds, accompanied by pan‑flute melodies retelling ancestral migration across the lake.</p>
          <p>Oral storytelling—the <em>living library</em> of Uros history—blends myth and memory, preserving social values while strengthening bonds between generations.</p>

          <h3>Fishing, Handicrafts & Tourism</h3>
          <p>Fishing is the communal heartbeat—teams depart at dawn to cast fine‑mesh nets, later dividing the catch equitably. Women specialize in <strong>totora‑reed handicrafts</strong>, crafting boats, mats, and intricate figurines sold to visitors.</p>
          <p><em>Community‑run tourism</em> now funds education and healthcare, yet elders actively manage visitor flow to protect both cultural integrity and environmental balance.</p>

          <h3>Consensus on the Floating Plaza</h3>
          <p>Political life blends tradition with necessity. Island councils—composed of elected representatives and spiritual leaders—meet weekly on a <strong>floating “plaza”</strong> to debate reed‑harvest quotas, visitor guidelines, and schooling timetables.</p>
          <p>Decisions require consensus, underscoring the community’s commitment to <em>shared survival</em> on the water. Younger members are continually invited to observe and contribute, ensuring leadership continuity across generations.</p>
